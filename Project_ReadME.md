WELCOME TO POKE-BATTLEGROUNDS

Welcome to our game we developed as our first react project for Flatiron school.
Our project was built using React as our frontend framework and using rails as our backend framework.

We built a turn based Pokemon battle simulator and plan on implementing live multiplayer battles once we go through learning websockets. Once Our app begins, player 1 will begin their turn and select their team of 6 pokemon. Once the user has selected all six pokemon, then a button for player 2 to select their team will appear. Click on the button for the next player to select his team. (We hope that even though you are using the same computer, you guys don't look at the screen when someone is choosing their pokemon). Once selected, the battle button will appear and take you to the battlepage.

On the battle page, players will take turn attacking each other until all pokemon in a player's team gets knocked out. When a player wins, a winner's page will come out and give the option of restarting the game again.
